# TODO

Work that's decided but not built, for the editor and the engine (odin_sdl_engine). Newest
sections first. When something is done, delete it here and describe it in the CLAUDE.md that
owns it.

## Code editor integration (asked 2026-10-23; build in this order)

The goal: the best Odin editing experience there is, because the editor knows the project (scenes,
assets, actions, animations, the running game). Code and scene editing should feel like one
environment: no memorizing how to refer to things in code. Everything goes through a small
provider interface in code_editor (completion, hover, diagnostics, gutter, inlay, drop sources)
that the editor fills in, so code_editor stays engine-agnostic. Not doing: a debugger (DAP), for now.

7. **Engine-aware code actions:** add a handler for this node's event, export this field (with a
   range), generate state machine constants, register this struct as a script, jump from an
   inspector field to its declaration.

Also queued (advised 2026-10-23, not yet approved): noticing assets added outside the editor
(scan on project open and window focus; auto-add, mark missing, a Refresh); the Mixer showing a
running game's levels and sending fader/effect edits to it live.

## Later (decided not to build yet)

- **Shader editing in the code editor** (asked 2026-10-22, for later). `.frag` files open in code
  tabs today but are treated as Odin. Four parts:
  1. Send only `.odin` files to OLS: every open document goes to the one shared server as
     `languageId "odin"`, so shaders likely reach OLS too (check what it does with them first).
  2. GLSL syntax highlighting: a GLSL tokenizer in code_editor/syntax (it supports a `Language`
     per file type; only `odin_language` exists), picked for `.frag` / `.glsl`.
  3. glslang's compile errors in the code tab (problems panel, squiggles) on save, not only in
     the Console: no language server needed.
  4. Completion, signature help, hover and diagnostics from a GLSL language server
     (glsl_analyzer, MIT, prebuilt for Linux / macOS / Windows): the code editor host runs one
     server per language instead of one for all tabs, and knows the engine's shader inputs
     (`v_color`, `v_uv`, `u_texture`, the Params block). Undecided: ship it in releases like the
     shader compilers, or use it only when installed (like OLS from PATH).

- **Mobile export targets** (Android, iOS): Odin can target both (`-subtarget:android`,
  `-subtarget:iphone`); needs the Android SDK/NDK here and CI's Mac for iOS (decided
  2026-10-22: later).
- **Steam's real backend**: the Steamworks SDK (a partner download) behind the engine's Steam API
  (built with a stub backend: steam.odin, 2026-10-22).

## Builds and releases

- **macOS bundle signing and notarization**, deferred until the version 1 release (decided
  2026-10-20; the Apple developer account exists). Then CI's
  `combine-macos` signs with the Developer ID (a temporary keychain, hardened runtime,
  `entitlements.plist`) and notarizes and staples the disk image with `xcrun notarytool`,
  falling back to ad hoc without the secrets. The secrets come from a gitignored `.env`
  (`tools/macos/signing.env.example`, `tools/macos/set_signing_secrets.sh`).
